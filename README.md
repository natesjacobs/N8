Process, analyze, and visualize 8D arrays (4D for space-time series, 4D for metadata)

This is a repository of scripts for working with imaging data saved as a single 8D array with dimensions 1-3 reserved for space, dimension 4 for time, and dimensions 5-8 for metadata (e.g., dimension 5 = condition, dimension 6 = subject, dimension 7 = trial, and dimension 8 = channel).
